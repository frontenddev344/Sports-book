                                These days, Copenhagen is overrun by Japanese and Korean eateries that combine the cuisine of
                                East Asia with New Nordic philosophy. 2018 saw the opening of Jah Izakaya, a casual, lively, and
                                welcoming gastropub with Japanese influences on a street close to the meatpacking area. It has
                                amazing beef cars, gyoza, tonkatsu, and Danish squid.

                                Suggested to me by a friend from Denmark, this light-filled location perched on a cliff overlooking the
                                Baltic was once a traditional family-run eatery, but the proprietors of the Sticks'n'Sushi business
                                transformed it into a more sophisticated dining experience. It's in an unexplored but rapidly developing
                                area around 90 minutes south of Copenhagen. A picnic of Danish oysters, locally caught scallops,
                                fish, and kimchi under the beech trees is a great way to round off a morning spent on the surrounding
                                beaches littered with fossils.

                                This restaurant and working farm in the town of Solara, named for a Cynic philosopher, takes the
                                concept of locavore extremely seriously. Pork ribs originate from the historic breed of pigs they
                                cultivate, the pickled vegetables are grown feet from the table, and the flour for the tortellini in brodo is
                                milled nearby. Here, following centuries-old methods, even the balsamic vinegar poured over frittatas
                                and ricotta flans is prepared. When visiting neighboring Modena, I usually make a stop for La
                                Lanterna and make sure I'm not the designated driver so I can savor the exhaustive variety of dry
                                lambruscos, which are also created in the area.

                                Au Vieux de la Vieille, Lille
                                The term "estaminet" refers to a specific type of restaurant found in northern France that originated
                                from the days when coal workers would get together for beer and small talk after work. The
                                estaminets are still there, and Au Vieux de la Vieille is among the best in Lille, even if the mines are
                                long gone. It serves traditional delicacies including potjevleesch (four meats in aspic jelly, which tastes
                                better than it sounds), beef carbonnade (made with beer and gingerbread), and dishes prepared with
                                maroilles, the pungent local cheese. With its racks of trinkets, rustic wooden tables and chairs, and
                                dried hops, the atmosphere adds just as much character to the experience as the cuisine.
                                Reservations are required.

                                receive a Michelin star. Chef António Galapito, a brilliant but extremely reserved individual who
                                worked with Nuno Mendes in London, has returned to Portugal and his food has reached new heights.
                                While all the product is prepared with a profound competence and punky sense, it is everything as
                                local as possible. Every time I visit Lisbon, I return and devour everything on the menu.

                                Rectsins Lucifernum has been named the greatest bar in Europe for 2023! An idea that is completely
                                macabre, absurd, and unorthodox; a place to enjoy a drink and share a life experience; a labor of
                                passion. At the modest-looking, ominous entrance, you will find a house brimming with gothic art,

                                antiques, and memorabilia. Dracula's Butler, with his blond hair, beckons you inside. A garden terrace
                                and underground bar are accessible from the mansion. That's only the very beginning. This Belgian
                                oddity can never be deemed showy because it is too unique and labor-intensive. Crazy games, great
                                beverages, and mingling with other guests in a cozy, tiny space with no more than 20 people in
                                attendance at once.

                                Szimpla Kert has written a great deal about it previously; in fact, everyone who even somewhat
                                follows the European bar scene is likely familiar with the idea of a "ruin bar," if not with the knowledge
                                that Szimpla Kert's ingenuity and pioneering were responsible for the development of the scene.

                                The mood and decor of Szimpla are so different from anything you've probably ever experienced that
                                your first visit seems almost like you're walking through a doorway into a different realm. Although
                                there are some parallels and the space is big enough to be considered a club, it seems much more
                                laid back than that. Yes, they open in the afternoon, when the atmosphere is languid and bohemian,
                                with people lounging around in kind of a squatter's ruin, albeit one that has been adorned.

                                within the pub and even spills outside, where one of their quirky furniture pieces and devices is
                                located on the pavement. Indeed, you will discover some golden fish, bowls atop heaps of books,
                                elaborate vintage lampshades, and rails and sideboards coated in wax that are adorned with intricate
                                details and crenulations. Though just decorative, the bar is really bizarre, with things placed in
                                unexpected places and the strangest stuff popping up. The portable black-and-white TV that is
                                perched on a toilet roll in the restrooms shouldn't worry you.
